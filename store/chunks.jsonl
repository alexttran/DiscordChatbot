Due to high demand, she explains how the Zoom meeting was initially limited to 100 participants but was later upgraded to accommodate more attendees.\nInternship Structure:\nThe internship is unpaid but offers valuable hands-on experience in AI product development. Participants will work alongside product managers (PMs) and other engineers to build real-life AI products.\nThe teams consist of software developers, data scientists, and product managers. The internship includes working on tasks like voice of customer interviews, MVP development, and go-to-market strategies.\nApplication and Selection Process:\nOver 2,000 applications were received. Applicants will undergo a technical assessment involving a coding task, which is crucial for selection.\nThe focus is on finding candidates with strong software engineering skills, AI knowledge, and the ability to work as team players. Dr. Nancy Li emphasizes the importance of commitment and dedication.\nTimeline and Commitment:\nThe internship runs for 3 months, with a minimum commitment of 10 hours per week.
